Measurable performance to 2024 shows large GHG and water-efficiency gains and big reductions in virgin plastic use. 3M scores highly for adoption and impact, slightly below the very top industry leaders on pure innovation leadership (because large-scale commercial carbon‑removal or CCUS deployments are still emerging and some technical details remain limited publicly).

The company reports substantial, verifiable progress across Scope 1-2 and meaningful Scope 3 reductions, rapid advancement of renewable energy in operations, and a structured future roadmap anchored in its “Science for Circular, Climate, and Community” focus and the 3M eXcellence operating model. Notable strengths include a validated near-term carbon target by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a public commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050, aggressive plastic-reduction and water-efficiency goals, and PFAS remediation efforts. Some benchmarking against peers shows 3M performing strongly in renewables and emissions accountability, though direct, apples-to-apples comparisons depend on methodology.
