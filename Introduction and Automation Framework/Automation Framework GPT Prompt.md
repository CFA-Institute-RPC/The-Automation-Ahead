Using this framework developed for GenAI task automation:
| Attribute | GenAI Automation |
|-----------|------------------|
| Data Type | Unstructured data (e.g., earnings transcripts, market news) |
| Task Variability | Repetitive and Variable tasks (e.g., customizing strategies, client communications) |
| Input Objectivity | Handles subjective, ambiguous inputs (e.g., free-form text) |
| Output Objectivity | Stochastic, probabilistic outputs (e.g., personalized reports) |
| Scalability | Scalable but with potential high computational cost | 
I would like to assess the following task:
<DESCRIBE THE TASK>
I have rated the task across various attributes using the following scorecard:
<INPUT SCORECARD>
Based on this scorecard, please provide a score for the overall GenAI automation suitability, a hybrid approach fit score, and the recommended hybrid approach, if appropriate, for automating this task, specifying where traditional automation, GenAI, and human intervention would be most effective. Consider the taskâ€™s variability, output objectivity, and potential risks in your recommendation.
