    "### Demonstrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Sentence Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we demonstrate how a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline works using a simple query and a set of text chunks. This approach combines embeddings, nearest neighbor search, and visualization to retrieve semantically similar information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow Overview:\n",
    "1. **Query and Chunks:**  \n",
    "   - A query (e.g., *\"What are the risks and benefits of investing in small-cap stocks?\"*) is provided.  \n",
    "   - Several chunks of information are defined, each discussing different investment topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Sentences:**  \n",
    "   - Each sentence (query and chunks) is converted into a high-dimensional vector representation using a text embedding model.  \n",
    "   - These embeddings encode the semantic meaning of the sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reducing Dimensions:**  \n",
    "   - To make the high-dimensional embeddings easier to visualize, we reduce their dimensions to 3D using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  \n",
    "   - This allows us to plot the embeddings in a 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Finding Similar Chunks (k-Nearest Neighbors):**  \n",
    "   - Using the queryâ€™s embedding, we search for the top `k=3` nearest neighbors (most semantically similar chunks) among the other embeddings.  \n",
    "   - Nearest neighbors are identified using a Euclidean distance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization:**  \n",
    "   - The query is plotted as a red dot.  \n",
    "   - The two closest chunks are highlighted in yellow.  \n",
    "   - All other chunks are plotted in blue.  \n",
    "   - Labels are added to make it easy to understand which point corresponds to which sentence.\n"
